## Overview

### Angular

The original application has been refactored to follow the guidelines specified by the [Angular Folder Structure](https://angular-folder-structure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) repository by [Mathis Garberg](https://mathisgarberg.no/#/about). Moreover, structural directives have been used where possible to improve the readability of `*.html` files. This of course means the app is now a little more dependent on TypeScript.

Inline `<svg/>` tags have been moved to a global `symbol-defs.svg` file in the `assets` folder. These are now dynamically loaded from `symbol` ids via the `svg-icon` shared component. For more information on how to organize svg icons using this method, check the excellent article [Using an SVG sprite icon system in Angular](https://medium.com/@rubenvermeulen/using-an-svg-sprite-icon-system-in-angular-9d4056357b60), written by [Ruben Vermeulen](https://twitter.com/rubverm) at [Medium](https://medium.com/).

### Tailwind CSS

The `html` and `css` code has been modified to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility classes as much as possible to give the app a similar look and feel to the original, including various effects and animations. The app now follows a mobile-first design that is fully responsive to most screen sizes.

For more information on how to integrate the two frameworks, check the excellent [Angular 8/9 + Tailwind CSS Guide](https://dev.to/seankerwin/angular-8-tailwind-css-guide-3m45) written by [Sean Kerwin](https://twitter.com/lordkerwin) at [DEV](https://dev.to/).

### ESLint

Linting is configured to use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the [angular-eslint](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) project. I followed the configuration examples referenced in their repository and it pretty much _just works&trade;_. Kudos to the team for the fantastic job they are doing.


### Karma / Jasmine

Unit tests have been reconfigured to run in a headless Chrome environment. Test and coverage results are thus printed to standard output, but both are still served to the appropriate development environment and can be checked in the browser, if desired.

## Use in Development

The application is configured to work with [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/). The corresponding `pnpm-lock.yaml` shrinkwrap file is provided.

#### Angular

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

#### Scripts

```sh
pnpm run serve      # start development server
pnpm run lint       # lint files using angular-eslint
pnpm run test:e2e   # run end-to-end tests via Protractor
pnpm run test:unit  # run unit tests via Karma
pnpm run coverage   # serve coverage results
pnpm run build      # build the project to /dist
```
