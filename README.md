# <center> Angular-Tailwind-ESLint </center>

A remake of the default starter app project generated by [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) (version 9.0.4).


## Overview

### Angular

To improve readability, I have leveraged structural directives where possible. This of course means the app is now a little more dependent on JavaScript. In addition, the project has been restructured to follow the guidelines specified by the [Angular Folder Structure](https://angular-folder-structure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) repository by [Mathis Garberg](https://mathisgarberg.no/#/about).

### Tailwind CSS

The original code has been modified to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility classes as much as possible to give the app a similar look and feel to the original, including various effects and animations. The app design also now is fully responsive to changes in screen size.

For more information on how to integrate the two frameworks, check the excellent [Angular 8/9 + Tailwind CSS Guide](https://dev.to/seankerwin/angular-8-tailwind-css-guide-3m45) written by [Sean Kerwin](https://twitter.com/lordkerwin) at [DEV](https://dev.to/).

### Inline SVGs

To keep things organized, I have moved inline `svg` tags to a global `symbol-defs.svg` file in the `assets` folder. These are now dynamically loaded from `symbol` ids via the `svg-icon` shared component.

For more information on how to organize svg icons using this method, check the excellent article [Using an SVG sprite icon system in Angular](https://medium.com/@rubenvermeulen/using-an-svg-sprite-icon-system-in-angular-9d4056357b60), written by [Ruben Vermeulen](https://twitter.com/rubverm) at [Medium](https://medium.com/).

### ESLint

Linting is configured to use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the [angular-eslint](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) project. I followed the configuration examples referenced in their repository and it pretty much _just works&trade;_. Kudos to the team for the fantastic job they are doing.


## Development

The application was installed using [pnpm](). The `pnpm-lock.yaml` shrinkwrap file is provided.

#### Angular

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

#### Scripts

```sh
pnpm run start      # start development server
pnpm run lint       # lint files using angular-eslint
pnpm run build      # build the project to /dist
pnpm run test:e2e   # run end-to-end tests via Protractor
pnpm run test:unit  # run unit tests via Karma
```
